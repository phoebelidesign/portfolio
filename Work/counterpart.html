        <p>An experimental newspaper exploring the notion of existing as a constituent of a whole, reflecting on my lived experience of twinhood. It contemplates the balance between symmetry and duality; my sense of self is at once distinct and deeply linked to another. I consider how this dynamic connects with a broader narrative - one where twin identity is often misunderstood, oversimplified, and commodified by the wider world. The newspaper format serves as a vessel that mirrors this accessibility and misinterpretation of twinhood in popular culture, highlighting the tension of information that exists both revealed and concealed.</p>
